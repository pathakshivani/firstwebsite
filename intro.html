				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				     <p>Practical or informal knowledge manifests itself as skills or ‘‘knowing-how’’. Practical knowledge is very important to understand how things actually work. As it occurs and develops in those concrete situations where it is learnt, it is contextual and social in nature and helps you acquire the specific techniques that become the tools of your trade. Practical knowledge leads to a much deeper understanding of a concept through the act of doing and personal experience. Practical knowledge is found to be of much use in our actual day-to-day work. There are a lot of things you can only learn through doing and experiencing; no matter how hard you try to learn that through theoretical means. For example, if you try to learn how to drive a car by theoretical means, you will probably spend your whole life to learn and still won’t be able to drive without proper practical training, hence practical is the must. Where theory is often taught in the idea of a vacuum, the practical is learned through the reality of life.</p>
