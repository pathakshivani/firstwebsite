				<h1>Objective<h1>
					<p>The Science textbook has been prepared in such a way that it includes various activities in each chapter. In most rural schools, students do not get opportunities to perform these activities. They do not have a laboratory facility in the school premises. Keeping these points in mind, CBSE has provided some activities in the lab manual, which can be performed with minimal equipment and materials. The activities provided in the CBSE Science lab manual for 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10 ,11 and 12 Classes will help the students of Class 6 to 12 learn Scientific concepts more effectively. This will inspire the young students towards Scientific pursuit and develop the scientific attitude in them. They will build skills like observation, hypothesis, experimentation, analysis, evaluation and conclusion drawing. The Scientific concepts of Classes 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10 ,11 and 12 are covered around themes like food, materials, the world of the living, moving things, people and ideas, how things work, natural phenomena and natural resources. Students will find all these details in the CBSE Science manual of upper primary and secondary classes.</p>
